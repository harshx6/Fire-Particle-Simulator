# 🔥 Fire Particle Simulator

A desktop-based particle simulation built in C++ that visually mimics the behavior of fire using dynamic particles, OpenGL rendering, and real-time graphics programming techniques.

---

## 🎯 Features

- Real-time particle system simulating fire and heat effects
- Customizable parameters: speed, size, intensity, color
- Smooth fade-outs, directional flow, and gravity effects
- Lightweight and performance-optimized using OpenGL

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- C++
- OpenGL
- Visual Studio (C++ Desktop Development)
- GLFW / GLEW (if used)
- GLSL Shaders (optional)

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

> 💡 This project requires a C++ environment with OpenGL libraries configured.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshx6/Fire-Particle-Simulator.git
```

### 2. Open in Visual Studio

- Open the `.sln` file (if available), or create a new project and add the source files manually
- Make sure OpenGL dependencies (GLFW, GLEW, etc.) are installed and linked
- Build and run the project
